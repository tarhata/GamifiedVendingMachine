Aruduino and Processing Code For Gamified Vending Machine

The Gamified Vending Machine was a prototype created to test the idea of using physical and mental exercise to promote healthy vending machine choices. Users are required to take the [Stroop test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroop_effect) using a foot activated controller. The more unhealthy a snack, the harder the Stroop test!
